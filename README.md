#### Banking System with OOP:

You have been hired as a Software Engineer to design a Banking System using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java. The bank provides two types of accounts:
1.	Savings Account - Earns interest but has a withdrawal limit.
2.	Current Account - Allows unlimited transactions but has a minimum balance requirement.

Your task is to design a class hierarchy using Encapsulation and Inheritance to model these accounts. Follow the requirements below:

# Core Requirements:
## Implement an abstract class BankAccount with:
- A private balance (should not be directly accessible outside the class).
-	Methods: deposit(double amount), withdraw(double amount), and checkBalance().
-	An abstract method calculateInterest() (only for SavingsAccount).

## Implement two subclasses:

#### SavingsAccount
- Has an interest rate (e.g., 4%).
- Allows only 3 withdrawals per month (if exceeded, display a warning).
- Interest is added to the balance every month.

#### CurrentAccount
- Requires a minimum balance of $500.
- If balance falls below $500, impose a penalty of $50.
- No interest is earned.

## Create a Bank class to simulate:
- Account creation (createAccount()).
- User transactions (deposit(), withdraw(), checkBalance()).
-	A method to simulate a monthly cycle where interest is applied and penalties are charged.

# Conditions:
- Prevent direct balance access (force balance modification only through deposit/withdraw).
- If a withdrawal in SavingsAccount exceeds the limit, display "Withdrawal limit exceeded!".
-	If CurrentAccount balance falls below $500, charge $50 and notify the user.
-	Ensure zero-argument withdrawal is not allowed (invalid transactions should be handled).
- Simulate an N-month period (where N is user-defined) and check if accounts behave correctly over time.

# Example Scenarios:
1.	John opens a SavingsAccount with $2000, withdraws 4 times, and gets a warning.
2.	Lisa has a CurrentAccount and her balance drops to $400 â†’ She is penalized.
3.	A bank cycle runs for 6 months, adding interest to SavingsAccount and charging penalties to CurrentAccount where applicable.

<ins>**Example 1:**</ins> Opening a Savings Account and Depositing
```bash
Welcome to the Banking System!
Select Account Type: 
1. Savings Account 
2. Current Account
>> 1
Enter initial deposit (minimum $1000): 
>> 2000

MENU:
1. Deposit
2. Withdraw
3. Check Balance
4. Apply Interest
5. Exit
Enter your choice: 
>> 1
Enter deposit amount: 
>> 500
Deposit successful. New Balance: $2500
```
<ins>**Example 2:**</ins> Withdrawing and Checking Balance in Current Account
```bash
Welcome to the Banking System!
Select Account Type: 
1. Savings Account 
2. Current Account
>> 2
Enter initial deposit (minimum $500): 
>> 600

MENU:
1. Deposit
2. Withdraw
3. Check Balance
5. Exit
Enter your choice: 
>> 2
Enter withdrawal amount: 
>> 200
Withdrawal successful. New Balance: $400
Minimum balance required. Penalty of $50 applied.
Final Balance: $350
```
